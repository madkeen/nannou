### A Quick Note

This project is brand new and there is a lot of work to be done. Feel free to
help out!

**nannou** is an open-source creative-coding toolkit for Rust. This collection of code makes at making it easy for artists to
express themselves with simple, fast, reliable, portable code.  Whether working
on a 12-month laser installation or a 5 minute sketch, this framework aims to
give artists easy access to the tools they need.

The project was started out of a desire for a creative coding framework inspired
by Processing, OpenFrameworks and Cinder, but for Rust. <sup>Named after
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Pkx37kYf4)</sup>

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the current stable release of Rust(https://www.rust-lang.org/) and Cargo by using ```rustup```.

On Linux and macOS systems, this is done as follows:
```
$ curl -sSf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh
```

If all goes well, you’ll see the following message appear:
```
Rust is installed now. Great! 
```

See what the code looks like by checking out [the
examples](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/tree/master/examples). *See the
following section to learn how to run these examples.*

If you're new to Rust, maybe check out [the official
  book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)?

Start your own project with:
```
cargo new my_project
cd my_project
```
Add `nannou = "0.5"` under the `[dependencies]` line in your Cargo.toml.  This
is everything you need to use the framework in your own project or sketch.
Rust's package manager *cargo* will automatically download and install
everything you need!

## Running Examples

Clone this git repo (which contains the examples) to your computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou
```
Change the current directory to `nannou`.
```
cd nannou
```
Run the example using cargo.
```
cargo run --release --example simple_window
```
The `--release` flag means we want to build with optimisations enabled.

To run any of the other examples, replace `simple_window` with the name of the
desired example.

## Goals

- Provide easy, cross-platform access to the things that artists need:
    - [x] Windowing & Events (via [winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit) and
      [glutin](https://crates.io/crates/glutin))
    - [x] Audio (via [CPAL](https://crates.io/crates/cpal)) *Input and output streams. Duplex are not yet supported.*
    - [x] GUI (via [conrod](https://crates.io/crates/conrod), *may switch to a
      native solution in the future*).
    - [x] OSC (via [rosc](https://crates.io/crates/rosc))
    - [ ] Graphics (via [glium](https://crates.io/crates/glium))
    - [ ] Video
    - [ ] Geometry
    - [ ] Lighting & Lasers (DMX, ILDA)
- Use only pure-rust libraries. New users should require nothing more than
  `cargo add nannou` and `cargo build` to get going.
- No `unsafe` code with the exception of bindings to operating systems or
  hardware APIs.
- Remove the need to decide between lots of different backends that provide
  access to the same hardware. Instead, we want to focus on a specific set of
  backends and make sure that they work well.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a language that is both highly expressive and blazingly fast. Here are
some of the reasons why we choose to use it:

- **Super fast**, as in [C and
  C++ fast](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/compare.php?lang=rust&lang2=gpp).
- [**A standard package manager**](https://crates.io/) that makes it very
  easy to handle dependencies and share your own projects in seconds.
- **Highly portable.** Easily build for MacOS, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS and
  [so many others](https://forge.rust-lang.org/platform-support.html).
- **No header files** (and no weird linking errors).
- **Sum Types and Pattern Matching** (and no `NULL`).
- **Local type inference**. Only write types where it matters, no need to repeat
  yourself.
- A more modern, **ƒunctional and expressive style**.
- **Memory safe and data-race-free!** Get your ideas down without the fear of
  creating pointer spaghetti or segfault time-sinks.
- **Immutability by default.** Easily distinguish between variables that can
  change and those that can't at a glance.
- **Module system** resulting in very clean and concise name spaces.
- One of the kindest internet communities we've come across (please visit
  mozilla's #rust or /r/rust if you're starting out and need any pointers)
